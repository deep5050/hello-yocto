# Getting Started with Yocto Project

Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project that helps developers to create custom Linux-based systems for embedded devices. With Yocto Project, developers can build a custom Linux distribution that fits their requirements and goals.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to set up Yocto Project on a Linux system.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- Git
- Python 3.6 or later
- BitBake
- Text editor of your choice (e.g., Vim, Nano, etc.)

## Step 1: Download Yocto Project

The first step is to download Yocto Project. You can do this by cloning the Yocto Project repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
```

This command will clone the Yocto Project repository into your current directory.

## Step 2: Set Up Build Environment

Once you have downloaded Yocto Project, you need to set up your build environment. To do this, you need to run the following commands:

```
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
```

These commands will set up the environment variables and configuration files required to build a custom Linux distribution.

## Step 3: Configure Build

After setting up the build environment, you need to configure the build. This is done by editing the `local.conf` file. Open the `local.conf` file in your text editor and add the following lines:

```
MACHINE ??= "qemux86"
DISTRO ?= "poky"
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"
USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"
PATCHRESOLVE = "noop"
BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "\
    STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G,100K \
    STOPTASKS,${DL_DIR},1G,100K \
    STOPTASKS,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K \
    STOPTASKS,/tmp,100M,100K \
    ABORT,${TMPDIR},100M,1K \
    ABORT,${DL_DIR},100M,1K \
    ABORT,${SSTATE_DIR},100M,1K \
    ABORT,/tmp,10M,1K"
CONF_VERSION = "1"
```

These lines define the machine architecture, distribution, package format, and other settings for the build.

## Step 4: Build the Image

With the build environment set up and the build configuration done, you are now ready to build your custom Linux distribution. Run the following command to start the build process:

```
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

This command will build the minimal core image for the qemux86 machine. You can replace `core-image-minimal` with the name of the image you want to build.

## Step 5: Run the Image

Once the image is built, you can run it on an emulator or a physical device. To run the image on an emulator, run the following command:

```
runqemu
```

This command will start the QEMU emulator and boot the image.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Yocto Project on your Linux system and built a custom Linux distribution. You can now explore more features of Yocto Project and customize your Linux distribution further.
